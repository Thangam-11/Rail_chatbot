# My Train Chatbot

## Introduction

"My Train Chatbot" is an innovative prototype application designed to simplify the process of accessing Indian Railways train information. Inspired by IRCTC's Disha 2.0, this chatbot offers a convenient and user-friendly way to get train schedules, travel durations, and other related details through natural language conversations.

## Problem Statement

Many people in India rely on trains for travel. Finding train schedules and details on the Indian Railways website can be time-consuming and frustrating due to its complex navigation and difficulty in finding specific information such as train availability, seat availability, travel times, and distances between stations. "My Train Chatbot" addresses these issues by providing an easier and more efficient way to access train information.

## Solution Overview

1. **LangChain** - Framework for developing applications using Large Language Models (LLM).
2. **openAI** - Text-based large language model.
3. **speech_recognition ** - Voice-to-Text conversion model.
4. **MySQL** - Relational Database.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- LangChain
- OpenAI
-  speech_recognition 
- Streamlit

## Tools / Frameworks Used

- **LangChain**: For developing applications with LLM.
- **openAI**: Provides text-based LLM capabilities.
- **speech_recognition**: Converts voice commands into text.
- **Streamlit**: Creates the web application interface.

## Architecture

The chatbot functionality is compiled into a Streamlit web application. Users can interact with the chatbot through a conversational interface using either text or voice input. The chatbot processes the retrieved data and presents it in a user-friendly format.

## Chatbot Functionality

- **Text Input**: Users can ask questions about specific trains, routes, and schedules.

  3. What is the distance between Udupi and Mangalore?


## Limitations

1. Users can interact with the chatbot only in English.
2. The chatbot can only handle specific queries and does not access real-time information. It uses static information stored in the database.

## Future Enhancements

- **Multilingual Support**: To widen user accessibility.
- **Real-Time Information Access**: Including seat availability, real-time tracking, PNR status, booking options, train delays, and notifications.
- **Enhanced Natural Language Understanding**: To improve interaction capabilities.
- **User-Friendly UI and Responses**: To provide a better user experience.
- **Recommendations**: Based on user queries.

## Conclusion

"My Train Chatbot" offers a promising solution for simplifying Indian railway inquiries. By leveraging LangChain and OpenAi LLM, the chatbot provides a basic but effective conversational interface for accessing train schedules and details. With further development, it has the potential to become a valuable tool for travelers across India, enhancing their overall travel experience.
